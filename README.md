## 📌 Project Overview

Urban pollution is a growing problem that affects public health, environmental sustainability, and overall quality of life. The **City Pollution Reduction Solver** aims to model pollution-related variables and provide computational insights that can help decision-makers evaluate pollution reduction strategies.

By leveraging numerical methods and interactive visualization, the application allows users to explore how changes in certain parameters may influence pollution levels in a city.
